  <h2>Ofer’s Life Story</h2>
  <p>Ofer Gerby was born on March 2, 1984, on an Israeli Air Force base where his father served. The youngest of four siblings, Ofer grew up in the serene surroundings of the village Ben Zakai. Among fields, orchards, and open skies, he developed a deep connection to nature, a love for freedom, and a strong moral compass.</p>
  <p>From a young age, Ofer stood out—his bright blue eyes, radiant smile, and magnetic personality made him a natural in front of the camera, even appearing in commercials by age thirteen. But his heart led him elsewhere. Inspired by his older brother, a combat soldier in the Givati Brigade, Ofer chose the path of service.</p>
  <p>He enlisted in the IDF in March 2002 and worked tirelessly to join the elite reconnaissance engineering unit of the Givati Brigade (Sayeret Givati). After overcoming demanding trials, he earned his place, completing the combat track with pride. He quickly rose to become a squad commander and was known by his peers and officers as a dedicated leader with golden hands, deep integrity, and boundless energy.</p>
  <p>Ofer was full of life. He loved sports, especially soccer, and played as a goalie for Maccabi Yavne. He rebuilt old machines for fun, documented his life through photography, and brought people together with his humor, kindness, and sense of purpose. He balanced his demanding military service with short but meaningful visits home, where he split his time between his beloved girlfriend Meital, his family, and his close-knit group of friends.</p>
  <p>On May 11, 2004, during a mission in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza to locate and destroy weapons manufacturing sites, a powerful IED detonated beneath the armored personnel carrier Ofer commanded. The vehicle, which carried explosives as part of the mission, was destroyed in the blast. Ofer and all five of his soldiers were killed instantly.</p>
  <p>He was just 20 years old.</p>
  <p>Ofer was buried in the military cemetery in Yavne. His legacy lives on not only in the hearts of his family, friends, and comrades but in the values he embodied—bravery, humility, loyalty, and love for the land. The Living Forest Project is a tribute to his spirit: a place of peace, growth, and memory.</p>

      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Behind our family home in Israel lies a 1-acre olive grove. Together as a family, we’re transforming it into a vibrant food forest — full of olive, pomegranate, fig, and fruit trees — as a living memorial for Ofer, our brother who fell in service.
