  <h2>Ofer’s Life Story</h2>
  <p>
    Ofer was more than a son and a brother — he was a light in our lives. With a heart full of kindness, a love for nature, and a strong sense of duty, he brought joy to everyone who knew him. His laughter, determination, and compassion left a deep mark on our family and community.
  </p>
  <p>
    After completing his military service with courage and honor, Ofer dreamed of living close to nature and creating spaces where people could gather and find peace. Although his time with us was tragically short, his spirit continues to guide us.
  </p>
  <p>
    This living forest is our tribute to his legacy — a place of life, beauty, and healing. A space for families to gather, children to explore, and nature to thrive. Ofer lives on in every tree, every flower, every laugh echoing through the paths.

      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Behind our family home in Israel lies a 1-acre olive grove. Together as a family, we’re transforming it into a vibrant food forest — full of olive, pomegranate, fig, and fruit trees — as a living memorial for Ofer, our brother who fell in service.
